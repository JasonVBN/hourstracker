**TODO:**
- DONE! ability to kick admins
- show URL along with QR (trivial)
- DONE! document submission (not as trivial)
- enforce file size limit
- DONE! send email updates abt admin status
- profile with bio (just for fun)
- "allow multiple submissions" choice for events
- optimization: retrieve only existence of doc, not doc data
